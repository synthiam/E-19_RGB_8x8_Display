This is an RGB Matrix display of 8x8 (64) Full color LEDs. Each LED can be individually controlled by EZ-builder to form messages, pictures, games, and more!

A few unique features of this display are that it is a smaller form factor (48x48mm) than common RGB matrix dispalys (60x60mm) and the green LEDs are a bright and vibrant green color!
